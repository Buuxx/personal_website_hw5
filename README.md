# Part 3. Website Enhancement

For Part3, the website enhancement, I made the following several changes to improve my websitel. First, I added sound to the buttons when clicking. This helps to improve user experience when they interact with the site. Besides that, instead of using httpbins as the form action, I used https://formspree.io/ to help me with handling the form data. By linking my formspree account to my email, I am now able to receive an email for every form submissions. This allows me to view and response to the contact messages on a daily basis. Aside from these improvments in functionality, I also improved the sturcture of the sites - I combined the shared CSS and JS contents into a seperate file, and added a variable css file to record all the used colors. This improved readability of my code and will fasten the process when adding new features in the future.
